## About The Project

This project was done as a part of machine learning course at Shahid Beheshti University. At first the main information of 1176 laptops is collected from [Torob](https://torob.com/) after that, this data is cleaned and 7 main features are extracted for the estimator. For the models, linear regression and lasso regression from scikit-learn are used.

## Collecting The Data

For Collecting the data, Selenium was used. The initially collected data had a lot of missing features and many of the numericall values had strings inside them. So at first the collected data was cleaned.

## Models

For models, linear regression and lasso regression were used and the result of the models was shown via the learning curve visualizer from yellowbrick.
